# Cypher
## So.. what is this?
This is **Cypher**; An AI wrapper with one goal: *Not suck.* I built this with a few principles in mind:

### Speed
It should be fast to get responses & fast to use overall. Don't make me spend 5 minutes loading a new chat page.

### Features
Too many companies have powerful AI models that can do so much more through raw text communication, but chose not to. I actually *want* to use my AI for cool things.

### Customization
AI should adapt to you, not the other way round. We give full control over how things act; Tools, 

### Privacy
Let me make this much clear:

***I DON'T WANT YOUR DATA.***

So I dont collect it. The only data that might get collected is from the APIs you use with Cypher. And we don't control that.

## Cool. How do I get started?
Well, as of now, I'm still working on Cypher! Expect a proper GH Page with the app on it soon. No domain, because I dont have money to drop on something like that.

## Okay, what if i'm a developer? I wanna help!
Easy. Pull up a terminal clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/notunk0wn23/Cypher.git
# Alternatively, if you use SSH:
# git clone git@github.com:notunk0wn23/Cypher.git
```

Then, install dependencies and run the app using:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
See how easy that was?
